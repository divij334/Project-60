    <p>Abdul kalam is my inspiration.I consider Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam as the most inspiring person in my life. He was a great scientist and was the 11th president of India. His life story is really inspiring for me. APJ Abdul Kalam was born on 15th October 1931. He was born and brought up in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu. His father, Jainulabdeeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque and his mother, Ashiamma, on the other hand was a house wife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth in Rameswaram. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister. He has reached heights even after being born and brought up in a small village.

He started his career as a scientist in Defense research and development organization. He worked under the great leadership of Vikram Sarabhai and was later transferred to ISRO. He was made the project director of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle). During his official tenure he visited NASA which inspired him to push for developing our own technology .When working with ISRO. Abdul Kalam was invited by none other than Raja Ramanna, the famous Indian physicist  to witness the country’s nuclear bomb test.  By then, Abdul Kalam was already well famous for developing different types of missiles. He also made nuclear tests successful. APJ Abdul Kalam later became the president of India, where he continued to inspire millions worldwide..

His books, India 2020 and Ignited Minds are worth reading. On July 27, 2015, APJ Abdul Kalam was invited to deliver  a speech in IIT Guwahati. When he was climbing the stairs, to reach the stage, he felt pain and during the speech, within 5 minutes he collapsed and later passed away.. His body was immediately taken to Chennai. Near to his house, they did his funeral.
        When I went to Rameswaram recently, I saw his house and felt proud.I remembere his famous quote, “Man needs difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success.”He will be always remembered for inspiring millions through this work and life. He is a perfect example for what Gandhiji once said- My life is my message.</p>
